# Trust-Management-Mechanisms-for-Detection-of-Infected-Devices 💻- Final Year Project For my coursework
Detection of Infected Devices in IoT using ML Algorithms 
(Scroll till the end I promise It won't be boring 😁)
<h3>We also managed to grab the best Final year project for the year 2018-2022🏆 </h3>

<h2>Objectives </h2>

<li> We use three machine learning algorithms Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron and Autoencoder. </li>
<li>Based on the literature survey, it has been found that a supervised as well as unsupervised model can be used in the detection of infected devices thus, we use the above three algorithms.</li>
<li>The dataset which was found needs to be properly processed along with normalization and standardization of data.</li>
<li>The dataset is combined together to make a new dataset consisting of balanced data.</li>
<li>Then we apply two classification algorithms such as Random Forest as well as Multilayer Perceptron to find the accuracy of our model to find the infected devices.</li>
<li>We then utilize the Autoencoder which is an unsupervised learning algorithm to teach our model the features which make up a normal device and then test on a dataset full of infected devices to check if it is able to identify them.</li>

In this project we are calculating the accuracy and recall values for the three different machine learning models: MLP, Random Forest and AutoEncoder

We choose Botnet attack which can perform Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) on the nodes. The reason why we choosed this attack is that, DDoS is a very common attack which can be performed on any application. In particular, we targeted Mirai and Bashlite malwares which are based on botnet attack. We have considered three algorithms, Multi-layer Perceptron, Random Forest and Autoencoder to train our model. With each model we observed different accuracies in detecting the infected devices. As a result, Autoencoder model was the one which was able to detect maximum number of anomalies and that is more suitable for our trust model.  

<h2>Future enhancement </h2>

This model was successful in detecting the infected devices from botnet attacks, the next step for this model is to actually deploy it in a network-based environment where it can detect real-time attacks. Further studies need to be done to incorporate hardware devices if it can be used in detecting the anomalies which would make our model more robust.
