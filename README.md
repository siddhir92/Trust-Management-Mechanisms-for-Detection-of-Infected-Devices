Detection of Infected Devices in IoT using ML Algorithms
<h2>Objectives </h2>

<li> We use three machine learning algorithms Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptron and Autoencoder. </li>
<li>Based on the literature survey, it has been found that a supervised as well as unsupervised model can be used in the detection of infected devices thus, we use the above three algorithms.</li>
<li>The dataset which was found needs to be properly processed along with normalization and standardization of data.</li>
<li>The dataset is combined together to make a new dataset consisting of balanced data.</li>
<li>Then we apply two classification algorithms such as Random Forest as well as Multilayer Perceptron to find the accuracy of our model to find the infected devices.</li>
<li>We then utilize the Autoencoder which is an unsupervised learning algorithm to teach our model the features which make up a normal device and then test on a dataset full of infected devices to check if it is able to identify them.</li>
